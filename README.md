📌 Development Branch Guidelines
Welcome to the Dev Branch! 🚀
This is where all code updates should go before merging into main.

🛠️ Steps to Contribute
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sports-Media-Interns/Fanz-Website.git

2️⃣ Switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev

3️⃣ Create a new branch for your task (e.g., homepage, navbar, etc.)
git checkout -b your-feature-name

4️⃣ Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature: your-feature-name"

5️⃣ Push your branch to the repository
git push origin your-feature-name

6️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR) to dev
Go to the GitHub repository
Click Pull Requests → New Pull Request
Select your branch → Compare & Review

⚠️ Important Notes
✅ DO NOT push code directly to main
✅ Get approval before merging into dev
✅ Test your code before submitting a PR

Once approved, we will merge into main. Let’s build something awesome together! 🎉
